# React-Restaurant-Menu
A small app that I made using React JS, that is basically a menu and an order list for a japanese restaurant. This is my first React JS project and I made it in order to get familiar with how React JS works.
## How to initialize the app on your local machine
Make sure you have Node JS installed on your machine. You can grab it here -> https://nodejs.org/en/
After you've cloned the repository and have made sure that you have Node JS on your machine, open up Command Prompt and cd into the folder of the repository.
Type "npm install" in your command line after you've made sure you're in the same folder where your app is.
After the node modules are done installing, type "npm start" in your command line after checking once again if you're in the same folder.
The browser will automatically open a tab on http://localhost:3000/ and you can view the app live there.
